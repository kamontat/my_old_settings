## Introduction

[SpaceVim](https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim) is a community-driven vim distribution with a bundle of modular configuration,
here we call these modules as layers, each layer has different plugins and config, users just need
to select the layers they need. It got inspired by [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). If you use SpaceVim,
please star it on github. It's a great way of getting feedback and gives me the kick to
put more time into development.
